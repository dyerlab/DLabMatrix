This package is the foundation layer for all matrix algebra routines needed in software developed for the iOS and OSX platforms from the [DyerLab](https://dyerlab.org).  The motivation herenotion here is to provide an abstraction layer relying as much upon the Swift Accelerate framework to allow population genetic and spatial analytic routines to be easily added to any deliverable product.

## Installation

**Swift Package Manager** (XCode 13)

1. Select **File** > **Swift Packages** > **Add Package Dependencyâ€¦** from the **File** menu.
2. Paste `https://github.com/Appracatappra/CircularProgressGauge.git` in the dialog box.
3. Follow the Xcode's instruction to complete the installation.

> Why not CocoaPods, or Carthage, or blank?

Supporting multiple dependency managers makes maintaining a library exponentially more complicated and time consuming.

Since, the **Swift Package Manager** is integrated with Xcode 11 (and greater), it's the easiest choice to support going further.
