# DLMatrix


This package is the foundation layer for all matrix algebra routines needed in software developed for the iOS and OSX platforms from the [DyerLab](https://dyerlab.org).  

The motivation herenotion here is to provide an abstraction layer relying as much upon the Swift Accelerate framework to allow population genetic and spatial analytic routines to be easily added to any deliverable product.
